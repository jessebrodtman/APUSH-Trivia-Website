        <h1>Period 7 APUSH Project Proposal</h1>
        <h3>By Ryan Rao, Richard Schulz, Gavin Frost, Jesse Brodtman</h3>
        <p>Our project will be a video game with Presidental trivia. We will have facts for each president with differing amounts of points, based on how difficult they are. A random fact will be generated the player will have to guess which president it describes.</p>
        <p>We believe we need a group of 4 due to the number of facts we wish to incorporate. In addition to coding the platform, we will have 4-6 facts per president so we need hundreds in total.</p>
        <p>PLEASE LET US BE A GROUP!!! THANKS MUCH!</p>
